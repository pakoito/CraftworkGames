CraftworkGUI
============

A GUI system designed especially for mobile games using [MonoGame](http://monogame.net) (an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4.x Framework).

Our goal is to make an easy to use GUI system with controls designed for touch screens.

## Developement Status

CraftworkGUI is currently in early development and is yet not ready for use in game. You can use it if you want but be aware that the API is likely to change.

The task list is on [Trello](https://trello.com/board/craftwork-gui/514653039560ea493a000292) with voting and commenting enabled.
