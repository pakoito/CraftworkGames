CraftworkGUI
============

A GUI system designed especially for mobile games using [MonoGame](http://monogame.net) (an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4.x Framework).

Our goal is to make an easy to use GUI system with controls designed for touch screens.

## Developement Status

CraftworkGUI is currently in early development and is not yet ready for use in a game. You can use it if you want but be aware that the API is likely to change.

The task list is on [Trello](https://trello.com/board/craftwork-gui/514653039560ea493a000292) with voting and commenting enabled.

Feel free to contact us via [twitter](http://twitter.com/craftworkgames) or our [contact page](http://www.craftworkgames.com/blog/contact-us/).

Screenshots and development updates will be posted on [our blog](http://www.craftworkgames.com/blog/).

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to take a copy of the code and start using it in your project. If you find any bugs or missing features let us know and we'll discuss it.

Once the project is more mature and the design is solid, we'll open up better contributing channels.

## License

The code is released under the same [Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt) to be compatible with MonoGame.
